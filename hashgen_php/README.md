### hashgen (php)
- this is a simplified version of hashgen written in php
- hashgen (php) has been surprisingly fast and has always remained a top performer during benchmarks 
  - https://github.com/cyclone-github/hashgen-testing/benchmarks
- hashgen (go) will remain my primary implementation of hashgen and I do not expect hashgen (php) to be maintained

### usage example:
- php hashgen.php -m md5 -w wordlist.txt -o output.txt
