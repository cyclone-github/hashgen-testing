### hashgen (python)
- this is a simplified version of hashgen written in python3
- fun fact, python3 is the first language hashgen was written in
- hashgen (go) will remain my primary implementation of hashgen and I do not expect hashgen (python) to be maintained

### usage example:
- python3 hashgen.py -m md5 -w wordlist.txt -o output.txt

### version history
